# 📘 OOP Assignment 1

## 📖 Description

This assignment demonstrates the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Python. It is divided into two activities:

1. **Activity 1 – Design Your Own Class 🏗️**

   * Create a custom class (e.g., Smartphone) with attributes and methods.
   * Use constructors to initialize objects.
   * Implement **inheritance** and apply **encapsulation** (getters/setters).

2. **Activity 2 – Polymorphism Challenge 🎭**

   * Create multiple classes (e.g., Car, Plane, Boat).
   * Each class defines the same method (`move()`) differently.
   * Demonstrates **polymorphism** through method overriding.

## 🚀 How to Run the Programs

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.8+ recommended).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run each activity separately:

```bash
python activity1.py
```

```bash
python activity2.py
```
